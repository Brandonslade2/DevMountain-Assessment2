    In this file, you'll be writing code to
    calculate order totals. You'll also be 
    creating customer objects.  
*/


//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*  
    Below is a cart array that has food objects
    inside. 

    Write a callback below that uses the reduce
    array method to calculate the sum of all
    the food. 
*/

const cart = [
    {
        name: 'pizza', 
        price: 9.99
    }, 
    {
        name: 'pasta', 
        price: 8.99
    }, 
    {
        name: 'salad', 
        price: 7.99
    }
]

//CODE HERE

const summedPrice = cart.reduce((acc, curr) =>  cart[0].price + curr.price, 0)


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*  
    Write a function called `calcFinalPrice` that
    can take in `cartTotal`,`couponValue`,
    and `tax` arguments. 

    Inside the function, calculate the tax 
    on the cartTotal and add it in. Subtract
    the value of the coupon. Return the final
    number. 

    Note: the numbers passed in for `tax` will be
    decimals, for example: .06 for a 6% tax.
*/

const calcFinalPrice = (cartTotal, couponValue, tax) => 
    cartTotal*(tax+1) - couponValue

console.log(calcFinalPrice(summedPrice, 1, 0.07))



//////////////////PROBLEM 3////////////////////
/*  
    In this problem, you'll create a model for 
    a customer object as well as an example
    object. 

    Plan out a customer object for the cart page.
    Think about the information that a 
    restaurant would need about its customers.

    In the TEXT ANSWER area below, describe the
    properties that your customer object will have
    and why you chose those properties.

    Explain what data types each property should be
    and why you chose those data types. 

    Your object should have at least 4 properties. 
*/

/*
    The customer will have name because need to call them by something
    The customer will have a phone number in case need to contact them by phone
    The customer will have an address to deliver or contact by mail.
    The customer will have a string of special instructions, called instructions, that are noted when serving the customer
*/

/*
    Now, create a customer object following your own
    guidelines.
*/

// just one object. one customer. ok.


var customer = {
    name: "Lich King",
    phonenumber: 8088080808,
    address: "Icecrown Citadel",
    intructions: "You may need to bring frost resistance gear when delivering"
}
